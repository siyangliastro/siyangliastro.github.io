Abstract: We present detector characterization of a state-of-the-art near-infrared (950 nm - 1650 nm) Discrete Avalanche
Photodiode detector (NIRDAPD) 5x5 array. We designed an experimental setup to characterize the NIRDAPD
dark count rate, photon detection efficiency (PDE), and non-linearity. The NIRDAPD array was illuminated
using a 1050 nm light-emitting diode (LED) as well as 980 nm, 1310 nm, and 1550 nm laser diodes. We find a dark
count rate of 3.3x$10^6$ cps, saturation at 1.2x$10^8$ photons per second, a photon detection efficiency of 14.8 % at 1050 nm, and pulse detection at 1 GHz. We characterized this NIRDAPD array for a future astrophysical program
that will search for technosignatures and other fast (> 1 Ghz) astrophysical transients as part of the Pulsed
All-sky Near-infrared Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) project. The PANOSETI
program will consist of an all-sky optical (350 - 800 nm) observatory capable of observing the entire northern
hemisphere instantaneously and a wide-field NIR (950 - 1650 nm) component capable of drift scanning the entire
sky in 230 clear nights. PANOSETI aims to be the first wide-field fast-time response near-infrared transient
search.
