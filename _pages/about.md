Hello! My name is Siyang Li and I'm currently a first year PhD student in the Physics and Astronomy department at Johns Hopkins University. I'm currently working with Professor Adam Riess in the Supernovae, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark energy (SH0ES) group and using Cepheid variables to determine a 1% distance to the Andromeda Galaxy to help further reduce the overall unceratinty in the Hubble Constant and investigate potential tension beteen distance determination methods. I recieved my Bachelor of Arts with honors from the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with Professor George Smoot on developing a sub-millisecond resolution silicon photomultiplier camera for the Ultra-Fast Astronomy project, which will search for and constrain optical counterparts to fast radio bursts and other astrophysical transients.
