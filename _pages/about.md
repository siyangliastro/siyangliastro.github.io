Hello! My name is Siyang Li and I'm currently a first year PhD student in the Physics and Astronomy department at Johns Hopkins University. I'm interested in observational cosmology and refining the anchor of the cosmic distance ladder to measure the expansion rate of the universe and investigate the Hubble Tension. 

# My Research

I'm currently working with Professor Adam Riess in the Supernovae, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark energy (SH0ES) group and using Hubble Space Telescope observations of Cepheid variables to determine a 1.5% distance to the Andromeda Galaxy to help further reduce the overall unceratinty in the Hubble Constant and investigate potential tension beteen distance determination methods. Cepheid variables are pulsating stars that have mean magnitudes proportional to the logorithm of their periods and can be used as standard candles to determine extragalactic distances. By using a calibration to the Large Magellenic Cloud that uses the same filter system and combining near-infrared and visible observations into a reddening-free Wesenheit index, we are able to lower the uncertainty in the distance to M31 to an unprecedented level that also provides groundwork for using the Andromeda Galaxy as an anchor in the cosmic distance ladder that is comparable to other galaxies such as the Large Magellenic Cloud and NGC4258.


# My Background

I recieved my Bachelor of Arts in Physics with high honors from the University of California, Berkeley. There, I built a foundation in instrumentation working with Professor George F. Smoot on developing a silicon photomultiplier camera to search for and characterize optical counterparts to fast radio bursts and other astrophysical sub-millisecond transients. To work on this project and collaborate with various researchers, I visited Paris Diderot University in France, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China, and Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan. I also spent a summer working with Professor Shelley Wright and Dr. Jerome Maire in the Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence group at the University of California, San Diego, to characterize a near-infrared discrete avalanche photodiode 5x5 array that is currently being used to search the sky for extraterrestrial technosignatures and other near-infrared transients.
