Hello! My name is Siyang (Sean) Li, and I'm currently a fourth year PhD student in the Physics and Astronomy department at Johns Hopkins University. I'm interested in observational cosmology and refining anchors of the extragalactic distance ladder to measure the expansion rate of the universe and investigate the Hubble Tension. 

# My Research

I'm currently working with Professor Adam G. Riess in the Supernovae, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark energy (SH0ES) group and analyzing data from the James Webb, Hubble, and Gaia space telescopes to improve the standardization of and lower uncertainties in tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and J-region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) zero-point calibrations and extragalactic distance measurements. The TRGB and JAGB are standard candles that can be used to measure extragalactic distances and the expansion rate of the universe, H0. There is currently a 5 - 6 sigma difference between indirect and direct measurements of H0, and refining TRGB and JAGB measurements can help probe this tension.


# My Background

I recieved my Bachelor of Arts in Physics with high honors from the University of California, Berkeley. There, I built a foundation in instrumentation working with Professor George F. Smoot on developing a silicon photomultiplier camera to search for optical counterparts to fast radio bursts and other astrophysical sub-millisecond transients. To work on this project and collaborate with various researchers, I visited Paris Diderot University in France, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China, and Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan. I also spent a summer working with Professor Shelley Wright and Dr. Jerome Maire in the Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence group at the University of California, San Diego, to characterize a near-infrared discrete avalanche photodiode 5x5 array that is currently being used to search for extraterrestrial technosignatures and other near-infrared transients.
