Hello! My name is Siyang (Sean) Li, and I'm currently a third year PhD student in the Physics and Astronomy department at Johns Hopkins University. I'm interested in observational cosmology and refining the anchor of the cosmic distance ladder to measure the expansion rate of the universe and investigate the Hubble Tension. 

# My Research

I'm currently working with Professor Adam G. Riess in the Supernovae, H0, for the Equation of State of Dark energy (SH0ES) group and analyzing data from the Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia to better standardize and lower uncertainties in the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) zero-point calibration. The TRGB is a standard candle that can be used to measure extragalactic distances and the expansion rate of the universe, H0, and there is an ongoing debate on whether TRGB-based measurements of H0 support the hypothesis that new physics is needed to resolve the 5 - 6 sigma difference between indirect and direct measurements of H0. Current uncertainties in the TRGB zero-point make it difficult to discern whether this is the case, but improving the precision of TRGB calibrations, which is the largest contributor to the TRGB H0 error budget, as well as improving its standardization, can help clarify this issue.


# My Background

I recieved my Bachelor of Arts in Physics with high honors from the University of California, Berkeley. There, I built a foundation in instrumentation working with Professor George F. Smoot on developing a silicon photomultiplier camera to search for optical counterparts to fast radio bursts and other astrophysical sub-millisecond transients. To work on this project and collaborate with various researchers, I visited Paris Diderot University in France, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in China, and Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan. I also spent a summer working with Professor Shelley Wright and Dr. Jerome Maire in the Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared Optical Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence group at the University of California, San Diego, to characterize a near-infrared discrete avalanche photodiode 5x5 array that is currently being used to search for extraterrestrial technosignatures and other near-infrared transients.
